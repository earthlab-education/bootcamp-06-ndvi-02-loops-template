    "    \n",

    "  * `my_item` is called the **looping variable**. It changes every time through the loop, cycling through each element of `my_iterator`. \n",
    "  * `my_iterator` must be something that **iterates**, like a list or tuple. To iterate through each row of a `DataFrame`, you can use the `df.iterrows()` method to turn the `DataFrame` into an iterable that returns two values (the index and the row) for each row.\n",
    "  * Notice the **indentation** -- only the indented block of code after the `for/in` statement will be run repeatedly. This is different from other coding languages that use parentheses `()` or braces `{}` to surround the code that should be repeated.\n",
